			<h1> Lets Get Travelling! </h1>

			<h2> Antigua </h2>
				<ol>
					<li> Shirley Heights, an old military base for the 54th Regiment (2nd Battalion Dorset) from 1840 to the 1850s.</li>
					<li>Feeling adventurous? Take a pair of long trousers and boots and walk through the bushes to find undisturbed ruins. Otherwise head to the lookout point and grab a very strong rum punch while looking out over English Harbour, you are 490ft above sea level.</li>
					<li> Betty’s Hope, the only sugar mill on the island, which has been restored with a museum attached. The work that has gone into excavating the mill and surrounding plantation grounds is fantastic. The museum captures the basic history of colonialism, slavery and the impact on Antigua. </li>
					<li> With a rented car, or taxi, take a ride down fig tree drive (the best time is in the summer months when the trees are in bloom). Along the way you should see Antigua Blacks, the islands pineapple, growing in the old plantation grounds. </li>
					<li> St. Johns, Antigua’s city centre is a wonderful place to explore but to get a real feel for the island stay away from the port end of town as it is full of touristy stalls. Instead, either discover the old Cathedral (Church Street), Antiguan museum (Long Street) or the market where you get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily Antiguan life. </li>
					<li> Visiting Hemmingway’s, located on St. Mary’s Street, with balcony seats overlook the busy street below which makes for a great break from the heat of town. </li>
					<li> Fancy staying in the water and exploring the exotic array of marine life? Then head to Jolly Dive. </li>
					<li> You can also go Swimming with Sting-rays. The company take you out in a group of boats to a nearby reef. You are able to swim in the middle of the ocean surrounded by sting-rays, they swim up to you allowing you to ‘hold them’, stroke them and have photos. A surreal experience at most!</li>
					<li> Mermaid Gardens, hike through the bush around Gallon Bay to discover the natural pools of water and incredible clift-breaks from the crashing water. </li>
					<li> There are 365 beaches in Antigua – what else is there to say?</li>
				</ol>
