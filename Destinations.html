			<h2> Antigua </h2>

					<li>Feeling adventurous? Take a pair of long trousers and boots and walk through the bushes to find undisturbed ruins. Otherwise head to the lookout point and grab a very strong rum punch while looking out over English Harbour, you are 490ft above sea level.</li>
					<li> Betty’s Hope, the only sugar mill on the island, which has been restored with a museum attached. The work that has gone into excavating the mill and surrounding plantation grounds is fantastic. The museum captures the basic history of colonialism, slavery and the impact on Antigua. </li>

					<li> St. Johns, Antigua’s city centre is a wonderful place to explore but to get a real feel for the island stay away from the port end of town as it is full of touristy stalls. Instead, either discover the old Cathedral (Church Street), Antiguan museum (Long Street) or the market where you get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily Antiguan life. </li>
